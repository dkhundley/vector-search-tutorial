Age of Wonders 4,"Reception

Age of Wonders 4 received a positive reception on release. PCGamesN said: ""This is undoubtedly the best 4X game I’ve played in years, delivering top-notch exploration, combat, and diplomacy alongside a rewarding and dynamic customisation system."" Polygon said: ""Age of Wonders 4 is good fun as a solidly entertaining amalgamation of familiar things I love."" PC Gamer called the game ""A flavourful and inventive 4X"".

The game sold 250,000 copies in less than a week."
Aliens: Dark Descent,"Reception

Aliens: Dark Descent received ""generally favorable"" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.

Rock Paper Shotgun praised how the game recreated the atmosphere of Aliens, using elements of the franchise to help build tension, ""It's the first to really capture the white-knuckle vibe of setting up perimeters, quipping out that last line of top-tier banter you've been saving, and seeing the shapes on the motion tracker creep closer and squeal louder"". Eurogamer felt that the game didn't do anything to distinguish itself from other games inspired by XCOM: Enemy Unknown, ""Descent doesn't introduce any memorable mechanics or stylistic flourishes at the campaign level. It's as spare and utilitarian as the boxy grey architecture of the Otago itself"". While enjoying the Onslaught mechanic for increasing tension, IGN criticized the technical state of the game, writing, ""These issues are just a bit too frequent and a bit too game-breaking for me to look the other way"".

GamesRadar+ thought the game added interesting, unique flourishes to the tactical game formula, especially the safe room mechanic, ""It's a brilliant and original feature that makes you stop and consider your squad of toughs as a little more human than just walking guns"". Game Informer disliked the game's controls, ""Unfortunately, stealth sections through packs of sleeping Xenomorphs make squad movement feel cumbersome. And at times, crouching and clicking other buttons aren't snappy, leading to deadly encounters with enemies"". PC Gamer liked the increasing infestation that progressed each day, saying that it made the player make hard choices, ""It's a fascinating mixture of ideas that creates tons of emergent conundrums""."
Aquatico,"Reception
The game received mixed reviews upon release. Ken Allsop of PCGamesN described it as Subnautica meets Cities: Skylines. Rock, Paper, Shotgun praised its presentation and visuals, but criticized the gameplay as being too straightforward and uncompelling. PC Gamer was similar in its critique, stating that although there are 'charming details and inventive ideas', as well as a deep management system, the city itself never felt convincing, and gave it a score of 68. German GameStar likewise praised its setting, but said it offers too little to compete with other similar games in the genre, giving it 70%."
Atelier Ryza 3: Alchemist of the End & the Secret Key,"Reception

Upon release, Atelier Ryza 3 received ""generally favorable"" reviews on all platforms, according to review aggregator Metacritic.

PJ O'Reilly wrote for Nintendo Life that the game is so far the best in the Atelier series:  ""Despite some issues with small text, no English dub and a little fussiness in how information is relayed"", ""Atelier Ryza 3: Alchemist of the End & the Secret Key ends Ryza's three-game run on a high note, serving up a heady mix of exploration, crafting and combat that benefits greatly from a narrative arc that's had time to develop and grow.""

Jean-Karlo Lemus wrote for Anime News Network and gave a B+, explaining ""that's a purely analytical score based on how I feel about the mechanics as a greater whole: battles are finicky, getting new recipes is a bit of a grind, and the keys feel almost superfluous. But the experience of this game is one to treasure, especially if you've got the added experience of having played Ryza's other two games. This is a lovely little game about a young woman and her friends making their last farewells to their childhood, stepping out into the world as adults.""

On March 31, 2023, Koei Tecmo announced total worldwide sales for Atelier Ryza 3 had surpassed 290,000 units. On April 27, 2023, Koei Tecmo announced that Atelier Ryza 3's sales had surpassed 300,000 units, making it the fastest selling game in the Secret series. On June 26, 2023, Koei Tecmo announced that the Atelier Ryza series has sold over two million units."
Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon,"Reception

Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon received ""generally favorable reviews"", according to review aggregator Metacritic.

Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon was the sixth bestselling retail game during its first week of release in Japan, with 6,474 physical copies being sold."
Birdie Wing: Golf Girls' Story,"Reception
The series was received positively. Briana Lawrence of The Mary Sue called the series ""delightfully bonkers"" and predicted future episodes would expand its ""wacky, sapphic vibe"". She later described the series as a ""fantastically campy golf (love) story"". Yuricon founder Erica Friedman argued that the series is similar to isekai like I'm in Love with the Villainess and argued it flouts the rules of the sports anime genre. She also called it a ""delightful romp"" with openly yuri themes and said it is close to becoming the ""greatest Yuri sports anime of all time"".

Alex Henderson of Anime Feminist, reviewing the first episode, criticized the series for its ""questionable tropes"" and tackling ""touchy subjects with [fairly] wild abandon"" but still argued it is entertaining and the most fun they ""ever had watching golf"". Vrai Kaiser of the same publication, reviewing the first four episodes, argued that the show's ""extreme sports angle"" wasn't as strong as it could be, and described the show as ""flashy"" and ""weird"" but said that the rivalry between Eve and Aoi gave the series ""an unexpectedly solid core"".

Reviewers for Anime News Network were more positive. They stated that they either loved the series, said it was cool with an ""utterly ridiculous premise"", were invested in seeing where the Aoi/Eve relationship went, described it as the best sports anime of the season, or otherwise praised the series. Nicholas Dupree and Steve Jones, writing for the same publication, said, in the This Week in Anime chatlog, that the series had a compelling angle when it came to the ""rivalry/romance between Eve and Aoi"" and praised the opening sequence."
Blood Bowl 3,"Reception

Blood Bowl 3 received ""mixed or average reviews"" according to review aggregator Metacritic, based on 22 reviews for Windows. Robin Valentine writing for PC Gamer criticised the microtransactions within the game along with the numerous bugs that were present during the review period just before release. The UI was described as 'messy' and 'awkward' and he found the players hard to differentiate. He went on to predict the game would have a 'disastrous launch' due to it being 'fundamentally unfinished'. Timothy Linward at Wargamer praised the core game and also the graphics as an improvement on its predecessor but found it hard to follow what was happening in the game or differentiate the player models on some teams. He also had problems with bugs and the AI of the game in single-player. Wargamer also criticised the early access due to the bugs, crashes and server issues at release with Cyanide coming out in a statement to say they were dealing with the problems and blamed the large volume of players overwhelming the servers. Wargamer also later conceded that the game they had reviewed was not representative of the one that was released. TheGamer praised the variety of cosmetic upgrades, the tournament management options and the core game but had doubts over the microtransaction and live-service direction of the game.

Jake Tucker in NME said that the game was ""Bug-infested and content-light"" and that it shouldn't have launched in such a poor condition. NME also collected fan reviews which criticised the microtransactions and the poor launch. Andrei Dumitrescu for Softpedia gave the game a positive review praising the customisation and tournament options but also pointing out the technical issues the game faced at launch. IGN couldn't find any reason to recommend the game over its predecessor describing it as ""a sloppy, muddy, buggy rehash of a better game"".

In the week of its release users on Steam had reviewed the game as 'mostly negative' due to the launch issues, monetisation, poor AI and bugs/crashes. Cyanide apologised for the poor launch and responded to the criticism around its monetisation system by saying they would make it fair, rewarding and optional."
Crash Team Rumble,"Reception

Crash Team Rumble received ""mixed or average"" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.

Game Informer felt like each character played like their mainline counterparts, writing, ""Controlling Crash – or one of nine other starting characters from the franchise – feels wonderful"". Destructoid criticized the game's monetization, but praised the focus on player agency: ""I've seen plenty of matches where individual players can make the difference in a marked way, cleaning up an entire team or blowing a crucial cooldown to defend a base when the enemy has the fruit they need to dunk and win""."
Crime Boss: Rockay City,"Reception

Crime Boss: Rockay City received ""mixed or average"" reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic, with an aggregate score of 52/100 based on 32 reviews.  

Many of the reviews wrote that most of the hired voice cast, despite their fame in movies, put in underwhelming performances.  Another complaint common to most reviews was that the stealth system to the game was overly finnicky and not well-supported, with the game eventually prompting players to get to the shooting regardless of how carefully an attempt at a stealthy approach was made.  Alice Bell of Rock Paper Shotgun said the game was a worse Payday, already a twelve-year old game in 2023.  Wesley LeBlanc of Game Informer was harsh, saying the gameplay was buggy and boring, and that the plot and characters were poorly written.  He gave the game a mere 3/10 overall score.   Cory Wells of Hardcore Gamer gave the game a cautiously positive review, warning that the game was neither exactly like Payday nor an open-world freeform game in the vein of the Grand Theft Auto series that many expected, but that gamers who didn't mind repetition would find a solid basic gameplay experience in the heists.   Luke Plunkett of Kotaku was derisive, writing that Crime Boss ""gets absolutely everything it sets out to do wrong"".  Writing a month after the PC release, he said that the game had attracted little comment and notice on the Internet, even negative, and noted the lack of a Steam release as a potential reason why."
Diablo IV,"Reception

Diablo IV received ""generally favorable"" reviews for the Windows and PlayStation 5 versions, and ""universal acclaim"" for the Xbox Series X version, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Windows Central called Diablo IV ""Blizzard's magnum opus"" and ""Blizzard's most important, pivotal game since World of Warcraft, exceeding all expectations."" The game was praised for its atmosphere, storytelling, visuals, level design, and overall improvements to the gameplay over its predecessor. Travis Northup of IGN called it ""a spectacular sequel"". He commended the gameplay, improvements made over Diablo III, and the uniqueness and customization options of the character classes, but criticized the repetition in the game's opening act, and some technical issues. PCGamesN praised the visuals and aesthetic, writing ""It's creepy, yet somehow beautiful"". While liking the endgame, Ars Technica felt the skill trees presented fewer options for upgrades than in Diablo III. 

Alessandro Barbosa of GameSpot wrote that the game's story was ""moving and engrossing"", particularly praising the handling of Lilith, the game's main antagonist. Barbosa thought that the game put a larger emphasis on companions than in previous Diablo installments, and highlighted the moment-to-moment action of the game as one of its strongest points. However, he criticized the boss fights in some of the game's more common dungeons for lacking in complexity, calling them less interesting than those encountered in the main story.

Polygon disliked the dungeon-crawling aspect of the game, feeling that it became repetitive fairly quickly, saying ""The procedurally generated dungeons don’t vary much in layout and feel like missed opportunities to have fun with randomized architecture"". VG247 praised the game's soundtrack as ""exceptional; equal parts haunting and daunting, just like its traumatised world"".

 Sales 
On June 6, 2023, Blizzard Entertainment announced that Diablo IV became the fastest-selling game in Blizzard Entertainment's history. Diablo IV has generated $666 million in revenue within the first 5 days of launch.

Final Fantasy XVI,"Reception

Critical reception
Final Fantasy XVI received ""generally favorable reviews"" based on 131 critics on Metacritic. According to OpenCritic, 93% of 135 critic reviews recommend the game.

Speaking about the story, Michael Higham of GameSpot praised the writing's handling of its darker themes and found the cast enjoyable, while IGNs Mitchell Saltzman was highly positive about the story and characters, and lauded the lead performances. Game Informer Wesley LaBlanc enjoyed the wider narrative, though he viewed a lack of diversity in the cast as undermining its themes, despite the fantasy setting. Jordan Middler, writing for Video Games Chronicle, found the story well told and its cast likeable after a slow start filled with worldbuilding and unfamiliar terminology.. Similarly, Zach Wilkerson of RPGFan found the female characters underdeveloped, though praised the narrative and the cast overall. Giovanni Colantonio of Digital Trends found the story lacked engagement after its shift away from Clive's revenge quest, additionally finding few of the characters memorable, but praised the overall lore.

Higham  praised the graphics and cinematics as adding to the overall story and design, while Wilkerson called the game's graphics ""incredible"". Middler lauded the overall visual design, but noted some stilted animation for side characters in some cutscenes. LaBlanc noted a lack of detail or variety in NPC designs and felt the visual effects got in the way of gameplay at times. A recurring complaint among reviewers was an unstable framerate. Soken's score for the game met with unanimous praise.

Higham described Final Fantasy XVI as the series' most drastic gameplay shift to date, praising the variety of ability combinations possible later into the game. Colantonio was pleased by the scale and spectacle of Eikon fights and enjoyed the combat despite it being driven by the story; he hoped the series would continue refining these elements in future installments. Evans-Thirlwell noted the wide variety of special abilities and customization elements to complement the basic combat mechanics, while LaBlanc called the battle system ""[his] favorite action combat system to date"" despite some pacing issues with quests and character progression. Saltzman highlighted the focus on wearing down enemies to inflict high damage and creating combination attacks as the strongest part of the combat system. Wilkerson praised the customization available to expand the combat options for new and experienced action game players, but felt the difficulty too easy overall and noted a lack of enemy variety. Middler praised the action combat, positively noting its brisk pace and lack of unnecessary filler would allow players to speed through the campaign. Several reviewers positively compared the scale and spectacle of Eikon battles to setpieces from God of War III and Asura's Wrath. Recurring criticism was focused on the lack of mechanical depth, and uninteresting side quest design.

Sales
Final Fantasy XVI sold over 3 million copies worldwide during its first week of release, and was also the best-selling retail game in Japan that week, with 336,027 physical copies being sold."
Fire Emblem Engage,"Reception

Critical reception
Fire Emblem Engage received ""generally favorable"" reviews according to the review aggregator Metacritic, where it has an aggregate score of 80/100 based on 127 reviews.  Reviewers generally considered the gameplay of Engage excellent.  PJ O'Reilly of Nintendo Life wrote that the gameplay was not merely the best in the series, but was of the finest quality of turn-based tactical RPGS in general.  Even reviewers who ultimately disliked the game tended to grant this; Hirun Cryer of GamesRadar+ called the work as a whole a missed opportunity, but still acknowledged it as one of the most absorbing turn-based games in years judged by its gameplay.  Exceptions to this gameplay praise were mostly in the Somniel: the optional minigames there were considered repetitive and uninteresting, although at least skippable.  The optional quasi-multiplayer modes were largely ignored by reviewers; Will Greenwald of PCMag called these modes underwhelming.  Reviewers generally thought that the graphics and soundtrack were outstanding, as well, with high production value cutscenes, exciting combat animations, and fitting music for each region.

Opinions were mixed on its story and characters.  Most reviewers agreed that the plot was weak, although disagreed on how much this detracted from the game.  Mike Mahardy of Polygon called the plot ""nothing short of terrible"" but admired the pacing and the sharp focus on gameplay: the player can quickly speed through the brief cutscenes and go from battle to battle.  Matthew Zawodniak of Nintendo World Report, while acknowledging the plot was thinner than previous entries, had a more positive view of the characters of Engage and considered them one of his favorite casts in the franchise.  Other reviewers were outright hostile to the cast, calling the support conversations between characters boring.

The explicit fanservice in the game's callbacks to the past Fire Emblem heroes as Emblems also received mixed critical opinions.   Brendan Graeber of IGN admired the result and the reverence Engage showed for previous Fire Emblems characters, while others thought that the Emblems took away limited screentime from the human characters.   Ash Parrish of The Verge criticized the support conversations between characters and Emblems; rather than letting the player learn more about heroes of earlier Fire Emblem games, the conversations were instead shallow, short, and uninteresting.  The Emblems hardly ever talked with each other, either.  More positively, the design on the ""Paralogue"" missions was praised; the late-game Paralogues are themed around a specific Emblem and feature a battle based on a chapter from that Emblem's original game.

Reviewers frequently compared the game with previous series entry Fire Emblem: Three Houses, in particular the change from a heartbreaking conflict between former friends to a more classic good vs. evil plotline.  Jordan Middler of Video Games Chronicle lamented that Engage threw away so many of the strengths of Three Houses that made it such a huge hit, and called it a missed opportunity.  Sisi Jiang of Kotaku wrote that Engage ""took ten steps back"" in terms of story from Three Houses.  Renata Price of Waypoint also said that Engage puzzlingly failed at all of the most notable strengths of Three Houses, such as in its far blander characters and unambitious setting, but that the excellently designed missions and deep tactical RPG gameplay of Engage surpassed the gameplay experience of Three Houses.

Sales

Fire Emblem Engage was the best-selling retail game during its first week of release in Japan, selling around 145,000 physical copies across the country.  By March 31, 2023, Engage had sold 1.61 million copies worldwide.  Engage had the second-highest digital sales at the Nintendo Switch eShop during the first half of 2023 in Japan, behind The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom."
Firmament (video game),"Reception

Firmament received a score of 69 on Metacritic, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"".

PC Gamer calls Firmament a ""graphically gorgeous descendant of Myst, paradoxically limited by its own ambitions"", praising the world design, but feeling the game lacked challenge compared to other puzzle games. Shacknews applauded Cyan Worlds for ""continuing to design these games without flashy ruckus, time limits, or deaths to speak of"", considering it ""ridiculously abstract at times"", but felt it captured much the same ambience as Myst. Softpedia praised the world design, but criticized the limitations of the narrative and of the character interaction with the environment, particularly with ascending stairs that were hard to notice. They noted that Firmament had a ""built-in audience of Myst fans"" to whom the quirks of the developer would appeal, but newcomers ""might be impressed by this world at first and will then struggle to engage with it"". They also compared the steampunk environment of Firmaments Realms to Columbia in BioShock Infinite, which ""reveals there was space for more originality"". Inverse criticized the narrative as ""too thin"" compared to Myst, Riven and Obduction, but praised ""Cyan's ability to make players care about fictional worlds"", calling it ""the most approachable game in the company's history"" and a ""perfect primer for the puzzle adventure genre at large"".

 Debate over artificial intellegence-generated assets 
Following the game's release, a backlash was encountered by the game's developers when a concerned player brought to fans' attention that the game utilized ""A.I. assisted content"", including pieces of artwork like backer portraits and unspecified amounts of the game's in-universe written text. The developers also acknowledged A.I. tools were used to edit the voice acting. Fans noted that they were not informed of this potentially controversial change during the Kickstarter campaign, believing that it resulted in an inferior game and amounted to plagiarism of actual artists.

In response, Cyan released a statement on June 9, 2023, which goes into detail of their use of the technology, noting that it was used to alter existing voice acting and was used to ""ideate"" the writing and art, but not used to provide assets directly."
Fuga: Melodies of Steel 2,"Reception

Fuga 2 received a 33 out of 40 total score from Japanese Famitsu magazine based on individual reviews of 9, 8, 8, and 8. Austin Wood of Yahoo! Singapore described the game as ""Beastars meets Valkyria Chronicles"", calling it ""a legitimately good strategy game;"" praising it for its moral and strategic choices. Azario Lopez of Niche Gamer found the title to be ""a remarkable sequel that borrows many gameplay elements and assets from its predecessor while introducing new systems that improve the experience,"" granting it an 8.5 out of 10. Lopez further remarked that the large amount of borrowed graphical assets from the first game does result in visual fatigue, and that full enjoyment of Fuga 2 relies on both having played the original and how invested the player is in the characters and their stories. John Cantees of GamingBolt stated that the sequel was ""a surprisingly solid tactical RPG that strikes a good balance between accessibility and skill"" giving it the final verdict of ""great"", John also pointed out how ""the story is hampered by weak writing and inconsistent characters, but apart from that there isn't much to complain about""."
Hi-Fi Rush,"Reception

Hi-Fi Rush received ""generally favorable"" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.

Jordan Middler, from Video Games Chronicle, said that Hi-Fi Rush is ""oozing with style and confidence"", although there are ""repetitive level design and some clunky platforming"", scoring with a 4 out of a 5 star rating. Jesse Norris, from XboxEra, praised the combat, calling it sublime, but ""can become difficult to read as the screen fills up with utter chaos"", scoring it with 9.5 out of 10. Diego Argüello, from Polygon, called its animation gorgeous and Jet Set Radio-esque art style vivid and arresting. Giovanni Colantonio, from Digital Trends, called it ""Tango Gameworks' most confident, stylish and surprising project to date"". On the other hand, Tyler Colp from PC Gamer found the game promising in its concept but ultimately average in the action genre, and thought its setlist of music was limited and dated.

The game reached 2 million players by March 2023, which has been counted as a mix of both digital sales and downloaded Game Pass subscriptions."
Honkai: Star Rail,"Reception

Honkai: Star Rail received ""generally favorable reviews"" according to review aggregator Metacritic.

Eurogamer recommended the game for its ""delightfully goofy humour, charismatic voice cast, and truly magnificent combat"", despite the writers' tendency to ""give one sentence explanations for important details, yet spend eight paragraphs overexplaining the simplest plot twist"". Rock Paper Shotgun called the game ""still in its early stages but (...) incredibly good fun to play"", comparing it to ""Star Ocean, but if everyone was hotter and you could gamble"". The reviewer praised the combat system for being deep yet approachable, and noted that, like in Genshin, spending money was not necessary to progress, as all content in the game could be cleared with the characters players receive for free. PC Gamer appreciated Star Rails ""impeccable visual style and strategic depth"" and its ""elastic tone, which fluctuates from the heroic optimism of a space opera, to the dark comedy of a Nier game, with a lot of Final Fantasy 14s soap opera storytelling mixed in"". To the reviewer, the game's main draw was its ""sheer creativity"" and that it ""distills what's most satisfying about turn-based RPGs: tactical, team-based decisions."""
Hrot,"Reception

On Metacritic, Hrot received  Generally favorable reviews.

Rock Paper Shotgun praises its design but criticizes its weapon selection."
Jagged Alliance 3,"Reception

Jagged Alliance 3 received ""generally favorable reviews"", according to review aggregator Metacritic."
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom,"Reception

According to the review aggregator Metacritic, Tears of the Kingdom received ""universal acclaim"".

Several critics praised the expansion of the open world introduced in Breath of the Wild. Tom Marks of IGN praised the addition of the sky islands and caves as ""massive"" and ""brilliant complements to the more traditional surface activities"". He also complimented the story as distinguishing itself from typical plots of Zelda games. Edwin Evans-Thirwell of Eurogamer praised the seamlessness of the ""loop between underworld and sky"", writing that while the ""caverns aren't always worth the toil of discovery, none of the sky islands feel dispensable"", praising the ""irresistible, toylike specificity"" of their design. On the differences from Breath of the Wild, Steve Watts of GameSpot praised the ""subtle ways"" the world had changed, saying that ""not everything is exactly the same or where you'd expect it to be, and the map is marked with myriad opportunities for exploration and curiosity"". Game Informer Kyle Hilliard ""didn't get the same goosebumps exploring Hyrule"" as he did from Breath of the Wild, but nevertheless ""adored returning to Hyrule with all new tools.""

Critics praised the addition of powers and building features to traverse and interact with the environment. Tom Marks of IGN wrote that ""the sandbox is bigger, richer, and somehow even more ambitious"", praising the building system as ""walking the line of powerful but approachable extremely well"", ""tons of fun"", and ""woven into every part"". Steve Watts of GameSpot described the powers as ""much more flexible"" than its predecessor and a ""beautifully implemented evolution of what made Breath of the Wild so special"", stating ""these tools give Tears of the Kingdom a particular flow that feels unique to the Zelda franchise."" Mike Mahardy of Polygon praised the emphasis on ""self-driven experimentation"" as ""paramount in traversal, combat, and discovery... Experimenting with each of [the] powers and discovering how they interact is the game.""

Several critics were mixed on the impact of performance problems. Alana Hagues of Nintendo Life wrote: ""It's evident that Tears of the Kingdom is pushing the system to its limits"", citing frame rate drops to the ""low 20s"" during ""busy fights and locations"", although stating ""it's not hugely disruptive, and it didn't feel any worse than Breath of the Wild... but it serves as a staunch reminder of the now-six-year-old console's limitations."" Writing that ""the Switch continues to show its age"", Mike Mahardy of Polygon noted ""the frame rate can still be abysmal, especially in dense forests or areas with busy water effects. Loading times are unpredictable, ranging from two seconds to 10."" Steve Watts of GameSpot noted concerns about the aging Switch hardware, saying he ""barely ever saw a hitch while playing mostly in handheld mode... even then, the performance dips were minor and temporary.""

Sales
Tears of the Kingdom was the first Nintendo-developed game to be priced at $70 in the US. More than 10 million copies of Tears of the Kingdom were sold in its first three days of release, making it the fastest-selling game in The Legend of Zelda franchise, as well as the fastest selling Nintendo game in the Americas with over four million copies sold in the US alone.

Loop8: Summer of Gods,"Reception

Destructoid favorably compared Loop8 to the Persona series of video games prior to release. Scott Adams of The OuterHaven who reviewed the full game described it as fantastic, praising the visuals, sound, and relationship mechanic, despite some issues with the game design.

Several other publications were less positive, with Cullen Black of RPG Site describing it as  full of great ideas that never come together. George Yang of Nintendo Life'''s view was that that it fails to leave an emotional impact towards the end and is repetitive and frustrating. Thomas Knight of NookGaming and Jenny Jones of Push Square echoed the criticism of its repetitive nature, mentioning going over the same conversations repeatedly. Thomas Knight also mentioned issues with inconsistency in conversations too, with events happening earlier than they should or in the wrong order.

The Nintendo Switch version of Loop8: Summer of Gods'' was the ninth bestselling retail game during its first week of release in Japan, with 5,796 physical copies being sold. The PlayStation 4 version was the sixteenth bestselling retail game in Japan throughout the same week, selling 2,775 physical copies."
The Lord of the Rings: Gollum,"Reception

The Lord of the Rings: Gollum received ""generally unfavorable"" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.

The game's technical aspects and stability were criticized. Digital Trends could not initially score the game due to persistent crashes until a day-one patch was released, the first time in the publication's history. Others faulted the user interface and perceived downgrading of Gollum's character model since the game's announcement.

Rock Paper Shotgun felt the opening was poorly paced, boring the player with fetch quests and pointless dialogue, ""While it does pick up somewhat in the second half, the first eight hours where Gollum is trying to escape the slave camps beneath Barad-dûr are nothing short of a slog"". The Guardian criticized the shoddy camera movement and general bugginess of the game, ""The whole game feels profoundly unstable, as if a stiff digital breeze would bring the entire thing down"". GameSpot disliked the boring mission design of the game, ""sans a few slightly more in-depth objectives at big story moments, the majority of your tasks amount to some version of, ""Follow the person!"" ""Collect the thing!"" or, in one case, literally ""Stand in line!""."
Master Detective Archives: Rain Code,"Reception

Master Detective Archives: Rain Code was the bestselling retail game during its first week of release in Japan, with 55,339 physical copies being sold across the country."
Meet Your Maker,"Reception

According to review aggregator Metacritic, the PC version of the game received ""generally positive reviews"", while the PS5 and the Xbox Series X versions of the game received ""mixed or average"" reviews.

Travis Northup from IGN described the game as a ""terrific concept"", and that the game's launch was a ""great start for a dungeon-delving shooter that’s as unique as it is hard to put down"". However, he wrote that at launch, the game did not have sufficient content and noted that the game had technical issues. Imogen Donovan from NME wrote that the game did not provide incentive for players to create ""artistically challenging"" levels. She felt that while the game sometimes offered a tense and satisfying experience, many of the levels created by players are way too difficult, and that ""outposts are built for greatest gain to the builder, not to the community""."
MLB The Show 23,"Reception
The game received generally positive reviews upon release."
Moderator Mayhem,"Reception
Moderator Mayhem was recognized as a way to better understand content moderation and the effect of policy thereon. The hosts of This Week in Google podcast said the game demonstrates how policies affect people, and that the game itself is an example of journalism.  Doctorow suggests it as important to discussions of content moderation, because of the impact of technology regulation on people's lives. Business Punk magazine suggests it may help the player appreciate the difficulty of the task of content moderation, while Rob Pegoraro of PC Magazine said the game showed him he did not want a job as a content moderator. Inforrm noted the game's relevance to discussions of legal compliance, media safety and free speech."
The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog,"Reception

Eurogamer noted that the game was received positively by players, with its Steam user reviews in its first weekend of release garnering it an ""overwhelmingly positive"" rating. According to Chrzanowski, the game was downloaded more than one million times in its first week."
OddBallers,"Reception
The game has received mixed reception from critics. IGN, Eurogamer, and NintendoLife all saw it as a fun but flawed game. Aspects praised include the core gameplay mechanics, amount of unlockables and customization for characters, and simple controls. The minigame that interwove beekeeping into the dodgeball formula was cited as a standout minigame. A major complaint was the game's online multiplayer, in that it was very difficult to find others to play with, and the inability to play online lessened the importance of the character customization, which was a major point of the game's progression."

Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo,"Reception

Ollie Reynolds declared the game to be ""one of the most intriguing and engaging narratives we’ve experienced in a good while"", and praised the game's visuals, characters, and horror scenes. Handley, while describing the game as having ""few bells and whistles"", said that it manages to be stylish, specifically with the wide panoramic backgrounds to search through.

Pikmin 4,"Reception

Pikmin 4 received ""generally favorable"" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Nintendo Life scored the game nine out of ten, praising the graphics, performance in both handheld and docked modes and level design."
Pizza Tower,"Reception

Pizza Tower received ""generally favorable reviews"", according to the review aggregate website Metacritic, and became one of the highest rated games of 2023 on Steam within a day of its release. Critics were surprised by Pizza Tower quality and considered it a worthy substitute for Wario Land, some calling it a rare spiritual successor that is better than its inspiration. Polygon said Pizza Tower ""has sharpened, tuned, evolved, and damn near perfected [Wario Land] odd niche of platforming"", and PC Gamer found it difficult to expect a potential Wario Land revival to be as invigorating and inventive. MeriStation said Pizza Tower was ""an instant classic"" and a breath of fresh air in the side-scrolling indie scene, which they felt was lacking creativity.

Reviewers favorably compared the visuals to 1990s Nicktoons like The Ren & Stimpy Show, Cartoon Network shows, and Microsoft Paint art. IGN said the intentionally cheap-looking art style lent Pizza Tower a striking, idiosyncratic appearance, and Multiplayer.it said the levels were so detailed that players would continue to find new animations for hours. The animation quality was also commended, as was the humor. IGN enjoyed Pizza Tower use of the cartoon trope in which characters are depicted in a different style for comedic effect, and alongside PC Gamer and Rock Paper Shotgun, praised the expressiveness of Peppino. PC Gamer said Peppino's animations made him feel like a fleshed-out character despite never speaking.

The soundtrack was acclaimed for its intensity. MeriStation said it complimented the visuals, Multiplayer.it wrote it combined funk with metal while remaining true to the style of 1990s platform games, and PC Gamer likened its ""clever"" blend of a retro style and samples to Jet Set Radio (2000). IGN said the soundtrack did an excellent job conveying the distinct atmosphere of each level. IGN and PC Gamer considered ""It's Pizza Time!"" a particular highlight. Beyond the soundtrack, Multiplayer.it praised the sound design, describing the sound effects as instantly iconic.

Critics commended Pizza Tower gameplay. They enjoyed each level's distinct theme and mechanics as well as the secrets scattered throughout, and compared the sense of speed to the Sonic the Hedgehog series. Reviewers felt it improved and expanded on the Wario Land formula, with Den of Geek calling it ""faster, crazier, [and] sillier"". Polygon and IGN highlighted the escape sequences, Multiplayer.it said the power-ups surpassed Wario Land in terms of surrealness and fun, and PC Gamer said the final boss's spectacle rivaled that of the Bayonetta series. IGN said that while Pizza Tower would only take five to six hours to finish, the secrets and ranking system provided substantial replay value, and MeriStation said replaying levels to obtain P ranks was where the gameplay was at its best. Polygon thought allowing the player to choose what they liked to achieve instead of featuring traditional difficulty levels was an ""elegant-ass approach to game difficulty"".

IGN, MeriStation, PC Gamer, and Polygon found controlling Peppino satisfying, PC Gamer likening his moveset to a Swiss Army knife for its versatility. Polygon described Peppino's abilities as limited but intuitive and excellently complementing the level design. Conversely, Multiplayer.it and Rock Paper Shotgun felt it was challenging to become accustomed to controlling Peppino since he requires considerable precision, which Rock Paper Shotgun said was Pizza Tower biggest flaw. While its levels were still designed in Wario Land slow and methodical fashion, Rock Paper Shotgun wrote, Pizza Tower expects the player to move fast, leading to the repeated frustration of losing momentum. They said this meant the game would not be for everyone, though some would consider the ""rough edges... an essential part of the appeal""."

Despite her praise for the game, in particularly its opening and final act, she wrote that the middle act was ""mediocre"".

Marcus Stewart from Game Informer strongly praised the game's visuals and music, calling it one of the best in the year, though he was disappointed by the game's puzzles design for not offering new challenges despite player's progression. Jordan Helms from Hardcore Gamer, while impressed by the game's visuals and music, wrote that the game was ""far from the most inventive or unique take on the puzzle-platformer formula""."
Like a Dragon: Ishin!,"Reception

Like a Dragon: Ishin! received ""generally favorable"" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.

Eurogamer liked the game's side stories but felt it retained much of its early eighth-gen DNA, ""Despite being rebuilt from the ground up in Unreal Engine 4, it feels as though the team has stuck with the same building plans as the original, where loading screens separate interiors and neighbouring locations, while NPCs retain the awkward, late-PS3 marionette look and movements"". Polygon praised the game's depiction of 19th century Kyoto, writing, ""The environments are gorgeously rendered, with unpaved roads punctuated by maple trees and streams that run through the city"".

Sales

Writing for The Verge, Andrew Webster said, ""I felt just like the main character: venturing out into the great unknown, constantly surprised and amazed by what I found."" Vikki Blake of Eurogamer praised the atmosphere and scrapbooking mechanics, but criticized the bike controls and the inability to create multiple save files.

The game's art direction was also the subject of praise. Watts described the world as ""bloody gorgeous"", while Vice wrote that the setting was ""as dense and beautiful as it is fleeting"" and the world design ""makes the act of photographing the dying valley a melancholy joy.""

The Guardian liked the biking mechanics and the camera, but criticized the world the protagonist explored, saying the world ""feels less like a real place and more like an amalgam of cultural influences scrubbed of their real-world significance"". GameSpot praised how much of the story and content was optional, giving the player freedom to decide what was meaningful to them, ""It also acts like an insightful mirror, reflecting back onto the player not just what they experienced, but how they interpreted it"".

Sales

By June 2023, Season: A Letter to the Future had sold 60,000 units, which was deemed a commercial failure for Scavengers Studio. This resulted in layoffs at the developer, leaving only 16 employees left."

Before the game released,  Rock Paper Shotgun Liam Richardson was optimistic about it, saying the demo was ""exactly what I hoped it would be."" PC Gamer writer Rich Stanton felt that despite there being a fair number of retro-style FPS games and finding the humor ""love it or hate it,"" he nevertheless found it ""kinda charming.""

Upon release, Richardson praised it as an accurate depiction of what teens found cool back in the 2000s, and praised it for feeling so similar to the build engine despite not using it. He also regarded it as one of his favorite indie games of 2023. TechRadar writer Jordan Forward-Lamb felt that, despite difficulty spikes and ""frustratingly old-school FPS design,"" he appreciated how creative it is and how it replicates the ""90s setting."" Destructoid writer Zoey Handley felt that the game was lacking in a lot of ways, including being too short, having too few enemies and weapons, and having bad flow, though she noted that some of the game's flaws may be deliberately done. Despite this, she found the game enjoyable due to its ""fascinating character exploration of its fictional designer Zane, particularly how much of himself he puts into the game. DualShockers writer Robert Zak noted that the protagonist was like a ""younger less studly brother of fellow 90s quipper Duke Nukem,"" though finding some of his dialogue ""grating."" Despite issues with the game, he found the repetitive gameplay and ""ever-intoxicating nostalgia"" enjoyable."

Game Informer wrote that the Drive System was a great addition, that it sets ""up a compelling risk/reward dynamic that tinges on every interaction"".

PCGamesN criticized the World Tour mode's storytelling as a disappointment, but noted that Capcom learned from its past mistakes and made the most ""feature-packed fighting game yet"", and that the expansive scope of SF6 will satisfy players with its abundant content without waiting for an Ultimate Edition to be released. Ars Technica enjoyed the accesibility options included: ""Blind and sight-impaired Street Fighter players will find a wealth of new options to help them play, like sounds that indicate distance to an opponent or if an attack hit high, mid, or low. It’s a really thoughtful touch, and I'm not aware of any other game doing something similar"".
